## Intended Audience 

1. For this particular website development project, my intended audience is 14 to 18 year olds. One of the many reasons behind this form of judgment is because I have found that young teens take a keen interest in participating in outdoor activities that take place in adventurous surroundings as well as experiencing new oppurtunities. Another reason for targeting this particular age is because teenagers have a large amount of great potiential in making changes to the outside world and helping to make a difference to lives that are less fortunate. 

## What are you doing 

To begin with, i am going to be creating a particular prototype for a company called "Invasion" and my main focus will be building a
website for one of the many Camps named Camp China and the reason for this being is because Invasion require a built up website that will 
target and attract users to join camp china for the summer. 

## What are you aiming to achieve

For this particular website development project, i am aiming to build an appropriate website that invasion require for their particualar camp named camp china.
