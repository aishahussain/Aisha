## Intended Audience 

1. For this particular website development project, my intended audience is 14 to 18 year olds. One of the many reasons behind this form of judgment is because I have found that young teens take a keen interest in participating in outdoor activities that take place in adventurous surroundings as well as experiencing new oppurtunities. Another reason for targeting this particular age is because teenagers have a large amount of great potiential in making changes to the outside world and helping to make a difference to lives that are less fortunate. 

## What are you doing 

In addition, for this website development project I am going to be creating a website for a particular company called "Invasion" and my main focus will be on a particular camp called camp China. For this project management unit I am also set out to create a design for the camp China website as well as put together all the requirements that ae necessary for this particular website that has been assigned to me.  Lastly, I have to take into consideration factors that may affect creating the website for camp china which could include time, limited resources and money.
