## Intended Audience 

For this particular website development project, my intended audience is 14 to 18 year olds. One of the many reasons behind this form of judgment is because I have found that young teens take a keen interest in participating in outdoor activities that take place in adventurous surroundings as well as experiencing new oppurtunities. Another reason for targeting this particular age is because teenagers have a large amount of great potiential in making changes to the outside world and helping to make a difference to lives that are less fortunate. 

## What are you doing 

To begin with, i am going to be creating a particular prototype for a company called "Invasion" and my main focus will be building a
website for one of the many Camps named Camp China and the reason for this being is because Invasion require a built up website that will 
target and attract users to join camp china for the summer. 

## What are you aiming to achieve

For this particular website development project, i am aiming to build an appropriate website that invasion require for their particular camp named camp china that isn't yet available to users on their Camp.co.uk website.

## Constraints 

During the course of building a website for the company called invasion there comes with many constraints that hinder the process of contruction. One of the many constraints include time and the reason for this is because i have been given a specific deadline as to when the website should be completed by which therefore means that time is very limited as there is only a short amount of space in order for me to complete the camp china website. 

## Benefits 

However, during the course of building the camp china website it has also come with many benefits and one the many is that i have been able to use my recent web developmement skills in order for my camp china website to be as successful as possible.

## Nature of interactivity 
My camp china website that will be created for invasion will include a range of interactivity. The reason behind this thought process is because my website will enable users to login into their account as well as allow users to join the camp china campus through a  certain button that will be placed on the home page. 

## Complexity of website 

I have found that my camp china wevbsite is quite complex to a certain degree as i have included a few complex features in order to improve the success of the prototype being created.
